Task String Manipulation

(StringBuilder, Scanner)

Write a simple program which reads a String of numbers devided by spaces from the console ("1 34 6 90 2020 54").
This String will get further analysed by methods which get programed in a new class "NumberAnalyser".
The NumberAnalyser class should have an attribute which takes in the String mentioned befor.
In the NumberAnalyser class should be a method called analyseSequence which processes the String.
The method should filter each number devided by a space and sort them by its checksum.
Edit the toString method of NumberAnalyser fulfill the example return value below.
The user should decide if he wants to analyse another sequence after every analysation process.
(Full example below)

("1 34 6 90 2020 54") toString:
"
Ausgabe:

1: 1
4: 2020
6: 6
7: 34
9: 90 54
"

On the console:
What does your sequence look like?
>"1 34 6 90 2020 54"

Ausgabe:

1: 1
4: 2020
6: 6
7: 34
9: 90 54

Do you want to analyse another sequence (y/n)?
>y

What does your sequence look like?

Do you want to analyse another sequence (y/n)?
>n
